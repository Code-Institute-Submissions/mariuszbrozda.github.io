 In project is a navigation where users can click a particular link which will bring users to content related with it by scrolling or redirect to a different subpage (such as ,,music,, subpage)
 Page can be scrolled manual also to the particular part of the page. In project were used technologies such as :

1. HTML to create structure of project
2. CSS to style project
3. Bootstrap framework to create responsive layout and add some styling and components by add helpfull classes
4. Font awesome

Project was based on Graceful degradation approach which means that desktop version was created as first then responsiveness was added for mobile and tablets.
Media query and bootstrap responsive classes were used to achieve that.
Projects responsiveness was testes by google developer tools where it was resising to particular device size(for example iphones,samsung )
It was tested also by changing size of browser window. I chose Desktop first approach because percentage of users using website will be using PC's
