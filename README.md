# TECHNOLOGIES USED:
``
In project were used technologies such as :
1. HTML to create structure of project
2. CSS to style project
3. Bootstrap framework to create responsive layout and add some styling and components by add helpfull classes [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
4. Font awesome [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
Project was based on Graceful degradation approach which means that desktop version was created as first then responsiveness was added for mobile and tablets.
Media query and bootstrap responsive classes were used to achieve that.

Project was tested manually by behaving as a user and go through the page.
Testing by clicking navigation links to check if they lead to expected destination.
Testing form by typing name, surname, email,message and clicking submit button.
Testing video and audio players by clicking play button to start and stop playing.
Testing page navigation by scrolling page down and up. (manually).
Testing logo link to check if leads to home page after clicking.
Testing hover efect in the albums section by hovering on every single album.
Projects responsiveness was tested by google developer tools where it was resising to particular device size(for example iphones,samsung )
It was tested also by changing size of browser window. I chose Desktop first approach because percentage of users using website will be using PC's

# BUGS AND ISSUES:
``
 There was a problem with navigation links responsivness. On small devices liks were to big and they covered some content of the page during scrolling. I found great solution for that by adding hamburger menu to the page on small devices resolution.
